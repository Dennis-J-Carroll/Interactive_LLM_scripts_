With LLMs we get a lot. It’s fairly obvious they’re incredibly capable. But as LLMs and other AI models become mainstream, many of us start to accumulate technical debt: the capabilities demonstrated by the model in a project or assignment can exceed the current skills of the person using it.

For one-off input→output tasks, that’s usually fine. But for maintenance and business growth, it’s not ideal. Overreliance on these tools can inhibit a healthy focus on the fundamentals.

The good news: as easy as it is to let AI do the work for us, it’s just as easy to have it teach us. With the “learning” modes available from Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI, we can chat our way from keyboard to click and build real understanding.

In response to the growing mountain of technical debt, I’ve adopted a practice: I ask different models and agents to craft interactive lesson scripts. Each script is tailored directly to the task I’m trying to accomplish. Sometimes I go deep on a single flag in a CLI command, follow a trail through libraries and syntax, and I don’t finish the script. That’s okay—because I still learned something valuable.

This repo curates those lesson scripts so others can find insight—both in using them and in the idea behind them.
